## :information_source: How does it work? (MVP)
Application works similiar to newsletters.  
1. Donators register by simply giving name/nickname, e-mail and blood type.  
2. Registered blood centers, can create blood request with specific blood type, and notify all registered donors with the same type about ongoing request.
3. Registered donors, with matching blodo type, will receive e-mail with question, if they want to participate.
4. If donor confirms participation, he/she will receive e-mail with details, what to do next.
